                            <p>To best utilise the scarce water of the region, farmers have needed to develop sophisticated technologies. Some use satellite farming techniques, whereby they gather data via satellite mapping; knowing the soil moisture in a paddock a half-hour's drive away can be done with a click of a button.</p>

                            <p>Although long maligned as too thirsty to grow in Australia, the rice crops of the Basin have the highest yields in the world. To save water, farmers use a laser to accurately level the paddocks. The end result is a flat, slightly slanted paddock where a smaller amount of water can flow across, get to the end, and be pumped back to the top to use again. <sup><a href="#">3</a></sup></p>

                                Australia is the driest continent in the world and regular rainfall cannot be relied on for most farmers, including in Australia’s food bowl – the Murray Darling Basin. So, in the years since European settlement, farmers connected by irrigation channels to, or neighbouring, the rivers in the Basin have taken out water from the system.
                                </p>
                                <p class="leadin">
                                This process was formalized in the twentieth century and water trading was set up to manage and distribute the commodity in the competing regions. But it still relied on a variable yard-stick to limit water use which is known as “The Cap”. This means that a water allocation purchased by a farmer is not a set amount of water they get each year; rather, it’s more like a share or percentage system.
                                </p>
                                <p class="leadin">
                                Farmers can hold permanent water allocations and trade temporary entitlements from year to year to bolster productivity between different types of agricultural production. For example, in times of drought rice farmers can choose not to plant their rice crop and instead sell their water allocations to farmers who have a long-life crop, like fruit trees, so they still have an income.

                            The remaining Basin water is consumed as drinking water, lost during transportation, or used for mining and industrial activity. While mining uses only a small proportion of the Basin’s water capital there are ongoing concerns about the mines’ affect on the health of the river system. <sup><a href="#">3</a></sup>

                            <p>Over three million people rely on the Murray Darling Basin for drinking water. The two largest Basin drinking cities of Canberra and Adelaide are at different extremes of the river system: Canberra sources its water at the upper end of the system, from subsidiaries of the Murrumbidgee river; and Adelaide gets its water from the end of the Murray River, after all of the other subsidiary rivers have flowed into it, and irrigators have taken water out of it.</p>

                            <p>A good gauge of the taste of the water is to measure the concentration of calcium carbonate in the drinking water. Higher levels of calcium carbonate mean that the water is ‘hard’ and has a strong mineral taste, whereas ‘soft’ water tastes flatter, or most would say <em class="italic">better</em>. <sup><a href="#">3</a></sup></p>

                            <p>Another controversial issue for the Basin is the large amount of water that is ‘lost’ during transmission. This is water that doesn’t get used for agriculture, as somewhere during its transportation from the river to the paddock it has either evaporated, seeped through a canal bank, flooded over the river bank onto a floodplain, or a bevy of issues caused by weaknesses in the irrigation infrastructure. Environmentalists argue that this water is not ‘lost’, and is actually naturally returning to the environment – topping up acquifers and maintaining natural floodplains and other important ecological considerations. <sup><a href="#">3</a></sup></p>

                                The 2008 Government report auditing the health of the Basin rivers showed that the it had been severely compromised. Water allocation policies have put pressure on farmers, leaving some areas without enough water during drought.

                                Farming fertilizers, chemicals and manure from livestock grazing collect in the river system, increasing nutrients which can lead to side effects including blue-green algae that can bloom uncontrollably, poisoning the water.

                                And farmland has often been cleared right up to the river banks damaging the ecosystem of the river, removing vital trees and shrubs from the riparian zone that help maintain river health. Land clearing has also caused the water table to rise increasing the risk of salinity.
